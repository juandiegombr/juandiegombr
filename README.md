## About me

I am a person with enthusiasm to learn something new every day. I am currently working as a Frontend developer at Mercadona Tech.

Testing, TDD, pairing... are essential practices in my daily work. Yes, like all of us I started working without these practices, but once I got to know them, it's something I can't do without. As a Product Developer, I seek to get quick feedback with everything I do and these tools give me that feedback which allows me to improve and create quality code.

During my years as a programmer I have been very interested in accessibility. I have always wanted to offer a good user experience, but I realized that we do not always take into account all users and their particularities. That is why I have worked to train myself and share my experiences in something that is a duty for me as programmers.

Having worked as a freelancer has offered me crucial learning as a person, among other things being able to improve the well-known "soft-skills" such as: problem solving, the ability to manage my own project, commitment, dedication, craft work...
